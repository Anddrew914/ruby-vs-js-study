# Ruby Versus Javascript Study

You've alredy learned the basics of programming with JavaScript, and you've
begun to think like a problem-solver. You've had practice reading JS code and
predicting execution by evaluating expressions in your mind.

We'll continue to reinforce the basics of programming, but this time with Ruby.
This may seem like a lot of material to cover in a short time, but the truth is
our task is simpler than it was when we introduced JS. Instead of teaching you
how to program, we'll focus on the *differences* between Ruby and JS with the
goal of utilizing the foundation we've already built.


## Prerequisites
