## Ruby vs. JavaScript: String Interpolation

What is a more DRY-compliant way to write this in Ruby? Experiment in `pry` and
place your answer below.

```ruby
[1] pry(main)> name = 'Jason'
=> "Jason"
[2] pry(main)> age = 28
=> 28
[3] pry(main)> name + ' is ' + age.to_s + ' years old.'
=> "Jason is 28 years old."
```

## Ruby vs. JavaScript: String Methods

1.  Open `pry` in your terminal and input `str = "ylbmessa lareneg"`.
1.  With what you now know about Ruby methods, reverse the string so that the
    output reads `"general assembly"`.
1.  Change the string into an array of characters so that the output reads
    `["g", "e", "n", "e", "r", "a", "l", " ", "a", "s", "s", "e", "m", "b", "l", "y"]`.
1.  Change your new array back into a string with hyphens in between characters
    so that your result is `"g-e-n-e-r-a-l- -a-s-s-e-m-b-l-y"`.  Even better,
    try to remove the two `-`s between `general` and `assembly` so that the
    result is `"g-e-n-e-r-a-l a-s-s-e-m-b-l-y"`.
